# Module 7: Capstone Project

!!! info "Duration"
    Extended session — 2+ hours

## Overview

Build a real tool or feature using everything you've learned throughout the workshop.

## Guidelines

1. **Choose a problem** from your actual work
2. **Design** the AI integration approach
3. **Implement** using the patterns and tools from previous modules
4. **Test** your solution thoroughly
5. **Present** to the group and get feedback

## Project Ideas

- AI-powered code review bot for your team's PRs
- Internal documentation search with RAG
- Automated test generator for your codebase
- Intelligent error log analyzer
- Natural language database query interface
- AI-assisted onboarding tool for new developers

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Practicality** — Does it solve a real problem?
- **AI Integration** — Is AI used effectively (not just for the sake of it)?
- **Quality** — Is the code production-ready?
- **Presentation** — Can you explain your approach clearly?
